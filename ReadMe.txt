Deployment:
For run this program you have to restore database TabletShop\DB\bak\TableShop.bak. 
Change \TabletShop\TabletShopService\Constants.cs connections string to yours and copy folder Resources to disk D: for successfully getting images. 

About Task:
I haven't used dependency injection because this product not required a lot number of inheritance objects, so when project become grow it would be reasons but now It makes code worse to read.


P.S.

If you have any question about project or problems with deployment. Please contact me.
